@revilo2002 @Vinamralongani @lufthansa Cabin altitude and the way pressurisation works in cabin on B787 and A359 keeps the cabin fresher and lower. The older generation airbus or boeing for the flight has higher cabin altitude and hence tiring flights. With Vistara service, I would be seen there.

I missed my raipur flight form t3 IGI just because of long line on your counter.
Your Manager was very rude.
He waisted our time in waiting.
I have lost 6 hours and ‚Çπ 9100.
I am a frequent traveler of vistara.

Thank you."

"@ankurmittal If you are using the same email id/mobile number for both your current CV account and SBI card, it should be done automatically according to the SBI/vistara website.
In reality, you have to remind them again and again."
@RounaKKinger Dear Rounak, safety is of paramount importance to us at Vistara. We had this investigated internally and would like to clarify that the aircraft landed normally, and there was absolutely no cause for concern/alarm. Thanks, Badri.
@revitup__ Applied for SBI Vistara recently. Lets see whether they are able to map mines correctly or would issue a new CV Number. Wife has axis vistara Infinite. They mapped her CV Number correctly after providing it during application.
RT @ankurmittal : When appying for Vistara co-branded cards, make sure to provide your CV number during application. It would save you from all the hassle. For SBI vistara card, check the CV Number in final application form which you have to esign. https://t.co/aT8liD25nz
@siyachandrie @wholetruthfood Love it! But Vistara has in flight entertainment na?
@aman6490 @ankurmittal Yes. But, if you want to link your existing CV Membership Number to your SBI Vistara Prime, you can request customer care or write a mail or lodge a ticket to change the CV Membership Number linked to your card.

@ankurmittal I did not have a CV account before. After i applied for SBI Vistara Prime and i am yet to receive the physical card. But yesterday i got a message stating that a new CV account has been opened. I think for someone who's new to CV, you don't have to do anything,they just create it

@sandeeprrao1991 @DjsAviation @BLRAirport Interesting, but Virgin being virgin would consider mounting more flights onto Mumbai and Delhi where they can tap into VIstara‚Äôs feeder than in BLR (6E fort domestic). Would be great if they interline and offer one stop for say MAA on Indigo. I‚Äôd fly them instead of BA direct.

@airvistara it was wonderful traveling with Vistara .it was my first trip with Vistara and it was so comfortable trip UK726...
@airvistara Might be your last resolution. This clearly isn't priority service. I know now what to do with Vistara for dishing out Deficiency of Service and deliberately being adamant about it parroting the same statement, but avoiding the truth that the bag did not come out on priority.

"@airvistara I found my bag in a damaged condition at Mumbai airport and I have complained multiple times but not received any resolutions from Vistara.

Worst Experience....!"
"#vistara #software #airlines 
Could not do a checkin for my upcoming flight all because they introduced  an upgrade software. Why do airlines force you through upgrade software when you want to do a simple checkin?"

@GoFirstairways Your agents charged me INR 1900 to add one letter in the name. And #vistara did the same thing for free.  I believe that's where class comes in. It is definetly not a Rule, just a convenience charge that you levy to extort from customers. Definetly not flying #GoFirst again.

@dgca @TataCompanies  I don't believe this. Still no call from Vistara. You  want us to believe it's an airlines worth trusting, spoling the name of Tata which is synonymous with credibility? Doubting that now. 7 calls and all i get is only assurances! Where is customer service? https://t.co/2TsMGQgU8G
