This message was received at 20:52 hours. Weird and very wrong timing of intimation according to me. No spicejet member was there, not a single person! Imagine the horror someone would face when they are flying for the first time and they don't know where to go.
@ari_maj I see it more as a SpiceJet problem rather than the pilot, no pilot would deliberately fly into turbulence.

"@kamlesm @KanpurUpdates @airindiain Spicejet had Kanpur-Kolkata daily flight during 2018-19 operating 186 seater B737-800 Max. It was a huge hit, going full from both sides. But internal problems within Spicejet forced them to discontinue in April 2019.

Hopefully it restarts with the new terminal."

Indian railways is better than Spicejet
Sir, Spicejet is rampantly and blatantly rescheduling flights and customer care is irresponsive even after hanging on for than 5 mins. Can airline regulators do something to control their nuisance ?  @PMOIndia
"Asking for your baggage information after 24hrs‚Ä¶.. and the Airline ( SPICEJET) replies to be patient. Is it asking for too much from the airline!!!

@DGCAIndia"
@MinCA_GOI What about the passengers strained at Jharsuguda Airport late night now as Spicejet delayed flight by 1 and half day and finally cancelled just before 2 hours of final revised schedule so late night. People hv cm from 150 k.m. far and whr will they go?? https://t.co/K95XjInX8c
@JM_Scindia   Can spicejet delays flight for 1 and half-day informs about the delay and finally cancel at the last minute when passengers come from 100-150 k.m. reach airport night at 8:30 p.m. just before 2 hour of final confirmed schedule https://t.co/VMfukyoSyI
Spicejet SG 3283 HYD-JRG has been cancelled after issuing boarding pass. My father senior citizen and family travelling with a 2 year old kid.Airline should provide accommodation and to and fro taxi charges. PNR Y9V3MF . Kindly help. @Officejmscindia  @JM_Scindia
@JM_Scindia Spicejet rescheduled Jharsuguda to Hyderabad flight on 14th to 15th Aug. Sent msg that it's delayed to 1035 p.m. Now at 8:30 p.m. when passengers started reaching Aitport, informed about cancelation.. passengers hv com from 100-150 k.m. far r strained at airport..

@flyspicejet @MoCA_GoI My flight ((PNR-QD4RSJ) was cancelled by spicejet on 18th July. I had to rush at the last minute. But, still i didn't receive the refund. This is disappointing. Please look into it. The spicejet customer care is a joke which is always busy and unresponsive.
