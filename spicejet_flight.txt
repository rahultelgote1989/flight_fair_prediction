@ari_maj I see it more as a SpiceJet problem rather than the pilot, no pilot would deliberately fly into turbulence.

Hello @JM_Scindia @DGCAIndia - Why do Airlines like Spicejet, GoFirst and Indigo force you to select and pay for a seat for web check in even though seat selection is optional? If you don’t select a seat they don’t enable web check in. This is a scam.
