@airindiain @TheSanjivKapoor Dear AirIndia. What makes a private enterprise different from a Govt enterprise is "Positive attitude &amp; Customer is the King". We expect the AI new management to explicitly tell their customer handling crew to come out of their "sarkari" mindset.
@RNTata2000 @airindiain Its my 3rd tweet and Its been 3 months..No sign of refund do you guys have any shame ? That’s how you will turn Airindia to profit by not refunding peoples money?and don’t comeback saying we are processing #airindialoot #shameonyouairindia #airindia
@airindiain For the last three month I have been writing to you is it such a big issues that the entire team of airindia is unable to resolve the same and taking such a long time how are managing the airline operations and risking so many ppl
@TheSanjivKapoor @airindiain Same thing happened with me in 2019. I asked the reason for seat change, but they just ignored me and told me that it's a better seat but actually it was the worst seat &amp; row in their A321 aircraft with no window. After that I've never flown with #AirIndia again.
@TheSanjivKapoor @airindiain Hello Sanjiv, I don’t know your legacy with Jet Airways But before commenting on AirIndia which is now owned and run by Tatas, takeout time and go through the comments of Jet customers - worst airlines operating outside India back then. Your staff at prestigious locations worst.
